# petitsPlats

Final project of the two classes "Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture" and "Web Design: Wireframes to Prototypes" by California Institute of the Arts on Coursera.
In the first half the task was to develop a comprehensive plan for a complex website (online delivery restaurant's website) by defining the strategy and scope of the site, as well as developing its information
architecture and overall structure. The second half was focused on the creation of wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and clickable prototypes.
